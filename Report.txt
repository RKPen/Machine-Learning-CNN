When trainable=False is the Right Choice
Feature Extraction: If you're using a pre-trained model to extract features from images and only want to train the new layers you add, setting trainable=False is appropriate. This approach is useful for transfer learning, where you leverage the pre-trained model's capabilities without changing its weights.
Training Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained model, training becomes faster because you're only training the new layers on top of it.
Avoiding Overfitting: In smaller datasets or when the pre-trained model has been trained on a large, diverse dataset, keeping the base model frozen can reduce the risk of overfitting.
When trainable=True is the Right Choice
Fine-Tuning: If you want to adjust the pre-trained model's weights to better fit your dataset, set trainable=True. This approach is called fine-tuning and is useful when you have a large dataset or want to adapt the pre-trained model to a specific domain.
Improving Performance: Fine-tuning can lead to better performance when the pre-trained model's context is different from your dataset, allowing you to adjust the weights for more specific patterns.
Conclusion: Which Should You Choose?
If you're using the pre-trained model primarily as a feature extractor and adding your own layers for training, keeping trainable=False is a valid approach.
If you aim to fine-tune the pre-trained model, adapt it to your dataset, or improve performance, set trainable=True.
Given that you have a new dataset, deciding whether to use the pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor or fine-tune it depends on the size and nature of your dataset:
Use trainable=False: If your dataset is small, or you want to leverage the general knowledge of the pre-trained model.
Use trainable=True: If you have a large dataset or the pre-trained model's context differs from your data, allowing you to fine-tune and improve the model's adaptability.
